# Checking if you have the right setup

## Access to GA Enterprise Git repo for DSI-42

Go to [DSI Master Repo](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dsi-sg/dsi-sg-42)

If you see a blank or error page, it means you did not tell us your Enterprise Git username

   2. Choose the `Private` option
   3. CHECK the `Add a README file` checkbox
   4. Click `Create` button -> This will create your personal repo like `https://git.generalassemb.ly/simonlau/dsi-sg-42`
4. On the next screen, click `Settings` (3rd row, rightmost)
5. On the next screen, click `Collaborators` on the left side of the screen

   1. type `stevenunez` into the box
   2. Click the `Add collaborator` button
