# Doing and Submitting Labs

Whenever you want to work on or submit your labs, do these steps

> Note: you should have completed ALL the steps in [0.2-update.md](0.2-update.md) previously

You will need to do this usually once a week or so

## Before doing your labs

After updating from the Master DSI repo, before doing your labs:

- Make sure you COPY and PASTE the entire lab folder (for example `1_01-lab-pokemon`):
  - FROM the Master DSI repo folder
  - TO your personal folder
    - making sure that `1_01-lab-pokemon` is inside your personal folder

For the above you can just use _Finder_ or _Windows Explorer_ depending on your machine.

## Doing your labs

Only do your labs inside your PERSONAL folder and not the Master DSI repo

## Submitting your labs

You will do these after you're done with the labs and wish to submit
