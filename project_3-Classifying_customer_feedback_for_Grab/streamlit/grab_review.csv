2 tablespoons...a tablespoon of gravy..,1
Ala Kadar food is only cooked. Not as usual.,1
"always contactless delivery, very convenient",1
"As a delivery application grab is terrible, in most cases couriers won't accept an order, so you stuck for 10 minutes unable to cancel it. And what's the point of priority/normal/safe delivery plans, if couriers only accept the most expensive one - priority? Have developers ever looked to other delivery apps like Wolt? It feels like I'm back to 2010",0
"Bad service, bad drivers wasting and take their own sweet time driving. No inform when reach. Sometimes last min alr go off with inform. No inform when needed for some issues",1
Be aware that this app allowed merchants to amend your order without the merchants notifying you. Often we don't have time to reorder food due to lunch break etc and only find out about the missing items during delivery,1
"Been waiting nearly for 50 minutes for them to find a driver. Can't cancel, can't call anyone. You are at the mercy of this app. grab taxi and crab mart seems to work well. But this is the last time I'm using grabfood.",1
"Cannot access the grab menu remotely. I once shopped long distances for family outside the city, with the nearest supermarket to my family's house. My position is indeed outside the reach of grab. Now it's no longer possible, the grab menu disappears if the current location has no service. Please upgrade please...",1
"Can't cancel order, the shop in the application and the original are not in sync, the application is available but the original is closed/no longer available",1
"Can't change driver. I ordered grabfood at 11.40, until 3 o'clock I called and chat didn't respond. I have also reported this issue but it takes a long time to respond, unlike Gofood where the response is fast. and until 4 (now) o'clock my food still wasn't picked up.",1
Can't even cancel my food order right after ordering wrongly ü•≤ü•≤,1
"complete orders,,on time delivery,yummy foods,thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è",1
Dear grab! Thankyou for providing us a really reliable app. I especially prefered to use grabfood for my delivered meals. But I would be glad if you could provide us Halal/pork derivatives filter in the app so I could easily pick a restaurant that is suitable for my diet. Thank you!,1
"Delivery on time, very efficient..",1
Double charged me 2 times. I haven't ordered in the app for 2 days and they charged me for the food I did not order. I already contacted customer's support but they don't have any response. Please give me back my money.,1
driver ingnored me for hours,1
"Easy to use, and the drivers are friendly and are quick to deliver",1
"Edit 3 - It's now 2024 and the app is worse than ever and rapidly getting worse. Utterly broken app that wastes so much of our time and allows drivers to get away with anything. Edit - even more broken now in 2022, the app now says the order has been 'delivered' the second the driver picks it up, meaning you are even more screwed than before if a problem comes up. Edit - In 2023 even worse than before. The executives of grab are utterly incompetent and parasitic, even by Vietnamese standards.",1
everything is delicious,1
everything was good. food is still hot and tasty,1
"Exceptional apps, but if I may wish to request, can grabfood be shared for tracking? Sometimes I order it for someone else, so I can check the location of the driver.",1
fast delivery,1
fast delivery,1
Fast Delivery and the delivery people are very good.,1
Fast delivery üöö,1
fast order,1
Fine delivery and transportation but I hope you never have an issue because the help centre is difficult to navigate and runs you in circles unable to actually file a complaint should you have one,1
Food prices are the most expensive and promotions are rare... I don't think it's recommended,1
friendly rider and very polite.,1
"From being the first market leader in this business, now it is lagging behind a lot. Ordering the standard model is not economical. Still waiting for delivery for almost an hour. If it was economical, I'd probably order today and eat tomorrow. The price is more expensive than other apps. There aren't many codes. You can order shopee food now before you eat üôÑ",1
"Full force app but most of the thing is not really functioning. One of the good example is some of the food vendor is operating on the app but actually is closing. The rider is wasting their time & effort to go to the 'closing' vendor. As for consumer side; wasting time, money & energy by hoping to get the food on schedule time. Even we can get the refund but it is still need some more time & effort, or else there will be nothing.",1

"grabfood algorithm is the worst I've ever used. For every 1 column, it kept on showing me 5 food I've ordered before. ""Deals around me"", shows 1 ad, and another 8 food I've ordered before. Search for ""pizza"", shows 1 pizza, and another 5 food I've ordered before. Then what's the point for having a secrion of your order history? Might as well be the entire page. Imagine using google, for every 1 search result it shows you 10 more links you've visited, that's how moronic grab algorithm is.",1
"grabfood app not optimized, consolidate multiple customer food orders deliver by a driver, causing delayed and changing ETA. Originally took 1 hour 15 mins as quoted but end up the food was delivered in 1 hour 45 mins. Went to customer service support to complain but chat was closed. grab app also keep direct to AI driven options which is not useful. Looking for refund or cancellation of orders or compensation. Delayed in food delivery by 30 mins is not acceptable.",1
grabfood prices are expensive compared to the store,1
grabfood rider asking for additional fee to file a report need to much info you can just ask for a evidence like our sms screenshot chat it will show our communication. Previous I already talk to your help line. As per chat they will give refund but no refund received Issue double charging of unli delivery subscription and worst my subscription not working meaning not free delivery of 49 pesos . Also the customer service ended our chat even were not finished Until now no refunds,1
"grab has so many scam delivery drivers. they would charge me for extra fees for their fake accidents. its been 3 days, those people are never seen and contacted again. please track your delivery drivers to prevent this",1
"grab is now charging forierners an additional 4% on top of their already set merchant processing fees (violation). Processing networks are based in the US and regulated at 4% domestic and international. Most businesses are charged 1.5% to 3.5% and on average about 2.2% everytime you use your card. International rates are only slightly higher. A Vietnamese person using VISA, MC or Amex will pay less. They say due to inflation, instead of raising prices for everyone they target foreigners. üö´",1
grabExpress is a bad experience. I was cancelled multiple times.,1
grabfood cannot chat the merchants. Annoying.,1
Great app. Very convenient for those who don't have time to go out,1
great delivered,1
Grocery items that was delivered will expired in 2 days from the day of delivery. The customer service solution was for me to consume it before it gets expired. This is a horrible experience.,1
"Haha, the delivery was late, but the money I paid was returned because I slept because I was so tired",1
"Hard to locate Proper Area for Delivery, unavailable Location in grab Map",1
Help center is not responding to my complaints about the restaurant cheating my order. Just use gojek instead. The apps suck,1
"Hey, this platform is a SCAM...where I'm using grab unlimited promo code to order food, merchant didn't have the stock and didn't call me for if i can replace any other item. end up the promo not being used and i have to pay the original price..after find customer service, they just give me a RM5 COUPON??? haloo.. if you give me choose RM5 coupon and RM7 grab unlimited coupon which one to choose???then what for i subscribe grab unlimited?? Lost Rm7 and give useless Rm5 coupon. really a big SCAM",1
"Honestly, I was actually helped by this grab. I just don't like it when there are multiple orders... orders take longer... I have to wait longer to get the food I bought... please improve the system... don't be like this...",1
Horrible Food delivery service!!!! Ordered Domino's at 13:20 and the estimated arrival was 14:01. Called grab support at 14:25 they said after 10mins contact Domino's directly the number provided no one picked as it was auto answer number without any option. Called other number no response. Then grab char said send Email to Domino's SERIOUSLY!!! Order placed via grab why I do all the Work to find out where my food is. Then why pay grab for delivery and merchant pay Commission?,1
I am missing an item from my order. This app doesn't have a redelivery and only offered me a refund by credits and reasoning that its Gcash problem???? I am still following up with their trash CS. Refund directly as I am no longer using this service,1
"I am so frustrated with your app! There is no option for me to chat with the merchant or the driver online or even just to add notes! I added an emergency contact number so in case they can't reach me, they can message the other person because I am using an international number. The more frustrating thing is that your grab driver was tagging it as delivered even they did not deliver the item to the right person! and when I am trying to contact grab to report it, it says page is not available!",1
"I can't process my order, i try it so many times.",1
I can't WA grab it straight away so my order is wrongüò≠,1
"I chose the delivery method and paid for the fast delivery price, but in reality the order arrived late. But at grab, they only deduct money and have no way to give feedback on service quality.",1
"I dislike their system. It takes too long to get a rider. Also, I experienced my order getting cancelled thrice recently for no damn reason. What even pissed me off more was I paid it via gcash and it took long for them to give back my money even though they're the ones who cancelled my order. Lastly, why do the riders always have no change for our money? It's so annoying knowing that most people who order are people who are at home all the time. Why would you expect us to have change?",1
I edit my review.. I don't recommend this app for food delivery. Because Many grab driver cancel your order if they don't want to deliver. Or if your place are very far from a distance.,1
"I feel the service from grab are poor, and never settle my problem at all, feel cheated and didn't get my refund while no delivery receive, drag until few months and say still checking without refund, especially Domino, keep passing around the ball",1
"I got a mail congratulating me on my first order on grabfood, which I never did! Can customer support look into the issue please? I left Malaysia about 6 days ago!",1
i just want to order fud why r u pushing me to buy unli deals and promo whatever.,1
"If you order food, the driver cancels the app without refund. The second time I finished ordering food, the app crashed. After resetting the app, the money was deducted and not refunded. Is the app a scam?",1
"I'm lazy to rate and I don't know this is the BEST app so far, it's low and then low fare on delivery, the discount is big especially when you have grab unlimited. Enjoy, even if you grab a car, grabfood and buy something. Don't change ü´∞üèºü•π super reliable customer care.",1
"Im not sure if its a new thing, but grab now group my order with other nearby orders to be sent by same driver... while its increase delivery efficiency, it also makes delivery longer...",1
I'm thankful..it's my first time to order..very fast and careful especially the rider is kind ....so always be careful with the riders,1
Ineffective search functions for Food and Mart categories. It is literally impossible to find what you want due to the search returning hundreds of irrelevant results.,1
Informed shipping cost Does not match with payment The price has increased Taking advantage of consumers,1
It doesn't have Veg and Non veg selection or even not showing in the food section. It is not good,1
It is very convenient. Thank you very much for sending the high layers,1
"It's really scary that the restaurant at grabfood has closed but you can still order. As a result, the driver went to the restaurant but had to cancel because it was closed. What's worse, customers can't cancel. And when the order is canceled by the driver, another driver will automatically be found. It's very detrimental to customers because they waste time waiting and it's detrimental to drivers because they go to a restaurant but end up canceling.",1
"jfc, i cant contact the store even if the store messaged me, the message wont pop up. the help centre ai is useless. the app is basically unhelpful when you need specific help.",1
"Just one click, and the foods I'm craving for...is on my doorsteep üòçüòçüòç",1
Just when you need to order it has become pointless. Been ordering since 11am up until 1:30pm the order still can't be placed. They have canceled the order many times.,1
"lately, the experience had been terrible, for grabfood, u should be able to cancel those restaurants that are not active, We've ordered to few different restaurants through grab but most of the times.. they cancelled our orders and other times, the grab driver went to the merchant but said the restaurant is closed? THEN HOW THE HELL WERE WE ABLE TO ORDER THROUGH THE APP?! PLEASE FIX YOUR APP grab",1
Man I hardly ever post reviews but ita gotten to a point where servixe is so terrible I'd rather uninstall the app. Can't even reach customer service and after waiting 1.5 hours still can't cancel the order. What is platinum service with premium support? Can't even reach them. Use to have a number to contact now replaced by a retarded bot. Sorry but not using this again.,1
Many drivers accept orders but do not move after the set time or do not move from their current location,1
Mcdonald near me ALL temporarily closed for delivery. Conveniently on lunch TIME TOO.,1
"Merchant can modify your order without contacting you. You order can be in the preparation stage whole day, since you are not allowed to cancel it under any circumstances. No live customer support. Some app mistake warns that they will suspend my account since I have more but I do not. Like a gumble, very unreliable",1
"Most drivers, especially in the food delivery parts, aren't always ready! They seemed like they didn't care about the customer! I don't know why you keep those typical drivers here. I have many issues with the food delivery riders here!",1
"My order arrived very quickly, thank you kuyang rider ü•∞",1
My order was cancelled because there was no one who'd deliver but the payment went through. The order was processing earlier but now I can't see the transaction anymore. What is this,1
My order with promos got cancelled and now I can't use it anymore. It feels very deceptive.,1
"my riders, why can't you cancel the order because the income is small.. no one starts with big income immediately.. we all started with nothing or zero balance..",1
Need to improve service.. And please reduce your charge neither to the shop nor the grab driver.,1
Nice and fast delivery,1
nice deli,1
no cutlery provided,1
No delivery from so many resturants. Closed often. Is this run by part time kitchen or lack of delivert drivers? No clear food pictures or actual food. All this should be made strict.,1
no help at all regarding old orders,1
"not clear. grabfood orders can't be canceled even though there's no one to pick up, where payment gets stuck in traffic jams like this. Is it polite to ask people to wait without confirmation?",1
"Offers are bad, and food delivery vouchery they give as compensation after delays is useless. With it you cannot apply anything else",1
on time,1
On time delivery and rider cooperate well. thank you.,1
ontime delivery...tq grab driver,1
"Paid for an order to be delivered in 25 minutes, then received after an hour.",1
"Pathetic service by grab. Remember this app loots you of your hard earned money. If the merchant changes the order because they don't have any item available and your order amount will fall lower than the amount on which you applied the promo, then grab will cancel that promo and you will not get any discount! For the mistake of grab and the merchant the customer ends up paying higher amount. What's the point of promising a promo on app if you are not going to honor it?",1
"Paying extra charge for faster delivery is a JOKE in this app!! The delivery is still DELAYED, but no option for refund of extra delivery charge üëé Also, make initiation of chat to merchant enabled!",1
"Place order with extra delivery fees and waiting for an hour for delivery, can't even cancel order, gonna delete grab and never use again, so disappointed with the way grab deal with restaurants always delay order.",1
"Poor app, cant chat merchant that sent its own food. Ex: d*mino* p**za",1
Prices for delivery are crazy now.,1
PWD discount on grabfood is gone for several days already. Please bring it back,1
Received a spoiled meal and melted Ice cream but just gave me a voucher but the voucher will only take the delivery fee. Chat supports are not true to their promise that refund will be thru grabpay JUST A USELESS VOUCHER.,1
"Recruit drivers more selectively, don't hesitate to cut, there are lots of people who want to apply, the lazy ones who have problems won't get any benefits",1
"Rute maps makin ngaco, driver handle multiple order at the same time is the dumbest idea",1
sana may free cod,1
seriously worried because they are don't have the option to cancel order.... and I'm chatting to grab person also same really worried... time god that drive only help me to go the restaurant and cancel the order for me,1
"Seriously, what's with this app? Added food, then the store switched to ""pickup only"" and cleared my cart! Happened a lot! Checked another app, delivery's there. grab's shooting itself in the foot. Plus, absurd delivery fee: RM9 for 3km!",1
"Sip on time, friendly and polite",1
So far there is no problem in taking the order,1
so fast delivery,1
Some drivers are following my order its creppy,1
"Sometimes good (not great) sometimes very bad. For a company that engages directly to the consumer, the customer service is laughable. Anyway if you want to cancel our orders due anything, get it done within 5 or even 10 minutes of our order. Don't cancel it after an hour of waiting. And the best part is, you can't directly talk to them asking what happened what so ever. The only reason I'm using your service is because I do not have any other options due to your monopolising market. Shameful",1
Super convenient to get meals delivered at our doors and to take a Taxi for going to any destination timely.,1
"super crunchy spicyüòã and delicious,love it‚ô•Ô∏è",1
"Teach the driver. If you don't want to take it, don't take the order. Order at whoosh Halim station, many drivers asked to cancel",1
"Thank you so much for your dedication and commitment of your super accommodating trusted and respected courier who go above and beyond to provide exceptional service to your customers. Their efforts do not go unnoticed, and their hard work is truly appreciated. Furthermore, your user-friendly app has made the delivery experience seamless and convenient for all users. The design and functionality of the app truly reflect your commitment to customer satisfaction and excellence.",1
thank you. fast delivery,1
The app is good but about to voucher cannot apply to other order...and delivery time is too long...30mins for 50php fee and 50mins for 30php fee...woooow ameeeezeeeeeng,1
"The CS is rubbish, the restaurant is closed and can't cancel. The CS call isn't picked up, it only takes credit. It takes up to 3 drivers to be able to cancel, the idiot who made the system",1
The delivery scope has been reduced to almost nothing to order. Very bad.,1
"The driver doesn't want to take the order, it's a pity that the seller's food is ready but the driver doesn't take it, the food is too bad, it's too bad to wait",1
"The food charges and delivery fees are ridiculously expensive, and the refund policy and delivery are awful. Waited for 1 hour, the food still not picked up by the deliverer. I've experienced this several times, and the company didn't even provide live support.",1
"The map is chaotic and incomplete, causing drivers to often ask for additional fares on the grounds that the points are inaccurate. Very detrimental to online shop sellers. Please fix it, it's complete on Gojek.",1
The number of hoops you have to jump through just to be able to reach a support agent and get help from a real human with your order has only gotten worse. Frankly it's ridiculous how difficult they make it to get real support for your orders.,1
"The stall is closed, orders cannot be canceled by drivers or users. The stall also didn't cancel. Money is being held up, orders are still being accepted by other drivers even though they are closed. Very bad.",1
There is no information that there is an order at the same time. When did grab become lalamove?,1
THEY ALLOW SELL OF DOG MEAT. You can't even report. There is no report function at all at the menu and resto. Just unbelievable. Very bad user experience. Totally only profit oriented. I won't use this app and uninstalled until they make it better.,1
They removed saver delivery for grabfood so everything is more expensive for no reason now.,1
This app works fine. It would be even better if the app developer include the feature to enable scanning of QR Code from screenshot album.,1
"This is my 2nd time paying for priority delivery but i did not get it on time. Instead, the delivery was extended for 30 more minutes. Very frustrating.",1
Too pricey and what's the point of having more expensive delivery rates when it's always late? If it's late then delivery fee should be refunded for more expensive delivery rates!,1
"Transaction can never go through? try to buy food but ""oops something went wrong"" so i also bobian oops i buy food from foodpanda?",1
Update your system on the app it says 7km how come? Im ordering from the store i know its only km from my location and on the app its 7km with higher delivery charge.,1
Used for grab car and food. Easy to use.,1
"Very bad UX, how we cannot chat with the restaurant, like if we want to make request, we cannot cause we cannot tell them",1
"Very bad. How come grab allow merchant to change order without agreement from customer, and there is no way to cancel the order. It doesnt even have a real human to help fix the issue. Why should i pay more because the merchant cut off some order and unable customer from using the discount from unlimited plan? Why dont you build a system that NOT allow merchant to change order by themselve and give option to customer to cancel and make new order?",1
Very Convenient! Good Delivery Service from McDonald's Restaurant!,1
Very satisfied with prompt delivery.,1
Very tasty,1
"Waited a long time for the food, apparently the driver fell asleep, then the driver finally canceled it, plus when I reordered the voucher was no longer there, so I had to pay more expensively ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1
Waitng is so long in grabfood when i just go to the restaurant myself order the food (take out) i even commute much faster than waiting for the rider to arrive,1
When i order drivers and they accept they take soo much time to arrive other than that not much to complain about fast delivery good navigation but its really frustrating when it comes to the speed.,1
"Why do I pay extra for the quick delivery option, and still my order gets delayed because the driver is handling multiple deliveries at once?",1
Why kick rider who demand justice...,1
Why stil hold money when my order get cancel.why no return automatic to my bank?why must ask my bank condition get my money back,1
will definitely order again,1
"Wrong order, and grab support does not reply",1
Yummy,1
"2 previous drivers cancelled my booking at last minutes for my advance booking, resulted me struggled to seek for urgent alternative transport. Glad at wee hours a driver took up my booking.",0
2023 to 2024 - grab has been better since my last post in 2019. I travelled to Thailand and there weren't any issues switching from my use in the Philippines to Thailand. Good job grab!,0
2024-03-16 grab started adding a 3% charge for foreign credit cards. Total bs because they don't get charged extra. I'm switching to Food Panda 2019-10-13 1) Credit cards keep getting rejected. I've used 6 different cards. MASTERCARD NOT ACCEPTED. VISA NOT ACCEPTED. OK so then what in the hell do you accept? 2) A lot of extra junk on the screen that is not related to the transportation. The location ( pick up and destination) selection is terrible,0

"am happy with the service, rider are polite and friendly. Good",0
"Annoying. I tried to book using GCash, unfortunately I couldn't get any grab taxi so I switched to grab Car. However, I couldn't book anymore because they already deducted the fare earlier when I didn't even get any ride. Now I don't know how long I should wait for it to get refunded and finally go home and rest. quite stupid.",0
App choose the longest route to charge more when there is a known str8 route to destination without traffic,0

Driver was amazing!,0

"Drivers can add additional fees at will, obviously there are no toll fees at my location, just play with OVO.",0
"Drivers love to accept, wait a period of time then cancel.",0
"Drivers who kill the internet should not be allowed, because you don't know where they are or what you booked for someone else. The driver should also not be allowed to take another passenger even after you have booked them, then the reason is that they are more expensive than us.",0
"Due to the poor GPS tracking of this app, after I pinpoint my location and once the booking is confirmed, the app automatically changes the pin location to another place, resulting in me being charged a fee for not showing up.",0
During a long wait at airport.i got to finally get a driver.but.Driver called to ask me thr customer to cancel ride.when i tried to ask why.the driver just rudely cut the call. The driver call and not text in message because want to avoid penalty of not accepting the ride.this is how the driver can escape grab penalty.grab will most time charge customer for cancelling without asking for reason.the blame is put on customer and not driver.beware!,0

"Fares have been getting unbelievably exorbitant and the fact that there are no other competitors (E-hailing platforms like gojek) allowed has allowed grab to monopolise the market and charge prices of above RM 20 that are ridiculously high for just a distance of less than 4km. And my review is not the first stating the same observation, it is a shame that this anti-competition is allowed.",0

Function that enabling application feeding order to driver who still carry previous passenger is really sucks. For customer it will take much longer before the driver arrive. For driver make them get lots of complaints and cancellations. 1 star rating for grab as long as this function still in operation.,0

grab drivers cancels bookings.,0
grab needs to develop a pre-booked ride feature. This will help users plan their travel time well. Drivers will also get information to prepare and navigate long trips. Hope grab reads my comment.,0
"grab Philippines You should consider adding motorcycle on your app soonest, or else someone will beat you to it.",0
grab your pussy. Often you get car drivers whose seats are dirty,0
"grabcar chooses to cancel and tells the customer to cancel the order ..grab please give a penalty to the rider who cancels more than 2 orders ..don't let the rider take the order 30 minutes after canceling more than 2 ..if there is no action, don't bother making the app like this .. it's troublesome ..",0

"Have saved place, but lets renew places so it wont be accurate and lets not talk about it, what a garbage",0
He was great. Nice and friendly!,0
helpful and polite. Best car we've been in for Manila,0
Helpful and safe driver.,0
honest and friendly driver,0
"Huge disappointment for grab transport, nowadays the driver can cancel anytime or don't bother do the ride...I had planned early to grab ended up late for events. After this ride will never try again.",0
"I always use this app to go anywhere far or near my house but now the longer I use this app the worse it gets because when I buy durian drive I don't want to take it if I go up more than two I don't want to take it also imagine 2 adults who other than that, only boys aged 10,7 and 1 are considered adults, not boys or babies, why are these people so stupid, this service app is very bad now they want service driving...",0
"I am deeply disappointed with the services provided by grab Philippines, and I feel compelled to share my experience to warn others and hold the company accountable for their shortcomings Recently I encountered multiple instances of unauthorized double charges on my grab bookings. Despite reaching out to grab's customer service for assistance I was met with a frustrating lack of resolution. Instead of addressing the issue and providing a satisfactory solution, the reps was repeating their script",0
I booked car from klia 2 to my hse. In a map shows correct but about to submit it shows Klia. I keep on change to Klia 2. After few attempt I submit the booking. lucky the grab driver call me to confirm my location. I told him at Klia 2 but his pick up at Klia. I told him abt problem I facing. He advised me and guide me to cancel the booking and submit new booking. I appreciate the driver but I feel bad for the cancelling charges due to ur system problem. this will be bad reputation for grab.,0
I do not find option for Cambodia in the app for airport transfer.,0
I don't like the price changes.,0
i forget my air buletooth in car,0
"I forgot my wallet with him and he turned off his cell phone. The driver's name is Jeffrey Catacutan Aquino, Clark City Philippines",0
I had a good ride today.,0
I had to cancel an earlier booking bcos your location finder isn't accurate. I chose my location but it came out I was in the departure area instead of my actual location which is arrival area in Terminal 3.,0
i like him,0
"I like to be annoyed, sometimes the discount when I want to ride a grabike is an error. There are times when when I open the APK there is a discount, then I go in and out again for a few minutes then come back again at the normal price which must be very expensive for students like me. Please fix the apk, fix the bugs and errors so that I can feel comfortable riding grabike without paying money.",0
"I recently had the pleasure of using grab Car, and I must say, it exceeded all my expectations. From start to finish, the experience was seamless and delightful.",0
I thought that waiting a car for 40 minutes is an issue but here is the real one: a driver threatens you with a knife to get out of his car because he waited for you too long! I will NEVER evere again use this app. Police report submitted. Good luck.,0
If it rains/holidays the rate also increases outside Nurul...ck3...that's the same as the customer üëé,0
"If there is urgent for ride ,there is no grabüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ",0
"If you have apps, you've met people, you can choose other people first, stupid",0
"Imagine everytime I call grab for almost half day but end up there was no car nearby ,what happen for those plp who in urgent .",0
"In our first call my husband was the one who booked it, we waited so long and was looking for the car number vios red. Then we were just cancelled for no show? How could that be? We didnt even see a glimpse of the car. The driver didnt bother to call us bfore he cancelled us and a penalty of 50 was charged automatically. We dont do grab always. Only if we come to manila. And we are very disappointed. Thats why we give you a very poor service.",0
Input correct location but grab GPS point incorrect pickup location as usual.,0
It helps alot for safety and fast travel.,0
"It is a very useful app for those who wants convenience in travelling just myself but upon using it the 2nd time and added my CC, it charged me P50 and that's not showing on the app. I just received a text messages that I was charged!",0
It is past and comfortable ride,0
It was canceled by the driver without any prior notification. Very disappointed,0
It‚Äôs expensive and slowwwwwww hahaha. It‚Äôs better to have your own car and drive yourself. go anywhere you want to go,0
"it's auto booking by grab car. especially when driver still on their way to send another customer. most of the time driver will only make you wait for very2 long, only to know that they doesn't want to take your booking. even if you message the driver earlier to ask if they gonna take the booking or not, they wont reply. even if we call they will not answer or they will get angry because they say, they still sending other customer. and if we only cancel after 5 minutes, we will be charged RM3.",0
"It's fast, bro, rider",0
Its never showed my accurate address. Each and every time i send my house num to the driver,0
"Its no use if you keep updating but still the same, people want to use grab for transportation not food delivery, i was a bit upset because i been use grab for about more than 3 years ,i cannot aford to buy my own car that why i use grab to take me to go work everyday and i realise that i keep getting high demand eventho no jammed with very very pricey which 2x higher from rm7-9 normal to rm17-20 with 7km far from home to my workplace and longer waiting time due to idk maybe less driver",0
"It's so hard to find a grab ride right now, every time I had to wait a few minutes or maybe more just to have someone to accept my order and then cancelled my ride, or maybe I got one after waiting so long and it's a very far ride.",0
"It's so sad that the grab system sucks, cannot use it for emergency. Every time, I wait so long because even if the driver has some passengers to drop off, they accept the booking like the other day I was waiting more than half an hour and when I cancelled I have to pay penalty üò¢üò¢üò¢ In Driver is much much better, thank God I have a choice",0
It's take a long time to find a driver,0
"Just a bad ux overall. All of the icons are cluttered everywhere, has a bad mapping ui system where the map legend flies everywhere and have trouble following or syncronizing the icons with the actual location. User safety is also questionable here where I've had many experiences where the driver just do as they pleases canceling or intentionally prolongs the pickup time for whatever reason. I've also had some experiences where i have trouble with connecting to the driver via chats and calls.",0
"just recently there was an accident involving a grab driver and a passenger. I've made a report, but I don't know how to grab it, it's just silent like shit",0
"lately I've been experiencing drivers who refused to cancel and refuse to pick up my calls when I try to contact them to see if they're coming. Not giving a reason or anything, only for me to find out the rates for rides went up after I booked. How do you justify or penalize actions of drivers who do this. It has caused me to miss my Bus and almost missed my flight a couple times because of the attitude of these kind of drivers.",0
less quantity of grab drivers,0
love it. way better than taxis,0
Make me easy when I want to anywhere,0
Many grab drivers sell expensive prices. So we cancel if it sells at a high price. Thank God Air Asia drivers don't sell too much. Great air asia ride,0
Many of the destinations I typed in weren't in grab üò° I had to switch to GoCar,0
"matched me with a driver 16 minutes away and expected me to pay $4 for cancellation fee, money grubbers",0
"most studied app first drives will take hrs to accept your ride, post that another hr to pick you up",0
"My fav app right now. App itself is very good and easy to use, obviously can switch to English. Rides. Excellent service. If your on a hurry, motorbike or a comfortable car if you need. Driver knows exactly where to go and few words are needed. This itself is outstanding. Food. I'm in Pattaya and the food partnerships are incredible. Each order has been by supervised by a loving hand. Tasty, fresh and superbly cooked AND efficiently delivered! Love grab Also has a tip button so please tip!",0
Nice and easy travel,0
nice driver,0
Nice grab driver.. And very helpful.,0
"Nice Guy, no messing around, drive is straight to our destination safely.",0
nice guy. got me there without killing me,0
"Nice one I will be charged a penalty if I cancel on grabshare but I won't get a compensation if the driver cancel my ride. No more good amount of points for transaction, just threw my grabcard away",0
Nice person and good job,0
Nice Ride,0
Nice service,0
"nice sir, smooth driving.",0
"Nice, clean and comfortable car.",0
No more multipoint? ü•≤,0
Not a bad app overall but drivers frequently cancel on you after you have already waited 15 minutes on them. Not very reliable... I would recommend Bolt instead if it is available in the country you are visiting.,0
Not satisfactory.. the driver now doesn't go to the place the customer specified.. the customer has to walk a long way to find a driver.. this has happened many times.. Please pick up the passenger where the passenger is..,0
"Not too happy with waiting for driver to drop someone else off. In some places I waited for half an hour before my driver arrive. This makes the driver arrival time unreliable, which messes with my arrival time",0
now days very very poor expensive very high ex;1km rm16üò±üò±,0
"Now grab is blocking users from booking grab when we cancel 2.rides at.a.time. when those rides drivers were too far away. No chance to reason them to unblock. That's why monopoly is dangerous for user. To everyone, better download app in-drive and try. You will see way less price difference between the two apps. grab monopoly will come to an end if enough people support new apps like in-drive",0
"nowadays, grab prices too much expensive",0
Ok as one the alternative transportations.,0
On time and reliable,0
Overpriced. Surcharges for taxi services are absurd (because it's a monopoly). Surcharges for food items are also absurd (higher prices than in restaurant itself plus delivery fee). Overall grab is a scam.,0
Passenger app grab,0
"paylater getting decreased, grab ride crazy expensive, food delivery charge higher than others app. should we just boycott grab for real?",0
perfect trip destination,0
"Perfect way to travel around in KL, TOP!",0
pleasant and polite driver.,0
PLEASE ADD ODD EVEN OPTION FOR grab CAR!,0
"Please allow your drivers to access other wayfinding apps. The maps used by the grab app are not OK. We are more often driven through alleys and closed/under construction vs. Waze or Google Maps. Now in Makati, Manila and Caloocan area.",0
"Please correct the accuracy of the maps. in the application the picture is already close, even though you are crossing the road, you have to go around the motorbike taxi first. waiting time changed to 15 minutes. it's troublesome if it's like that; troublesome drivers and users",0
Pls delete grab taxi app in this vivo device,0
Polite and Helpful.,0
polite and professional,0
Polite and welcomingüôè,0
"Poor maps accuracy, wasting time to wait",0
"Price increase.. Too high, especially peak hours.. Almost felt like peak hours all the time. Most people finish work at peak hours, not worth it during those time...",0
"Prices fare are getting more expensive..i hope more e hailing come,so we can choose the best price",0
punctual and friendly,0
Really nice and polite guy 5*s Very helpful,0
"reliable,safe and fast",0
"ride fares are expensive for pupils and students, vouchers are few",0
Ridiculous pricing. Ride are so hard to get. Maybe there's issue with grab management and their drivers.,0
safe drive,0
"Seriously this grab App sometime not working properly when Seaching location for other. Finally it's became to our own location. Waste of money, and unprofessionally job responses. Better uninstall for find better services. Go check detail the issue that you need to improve. Not always customer to tell you everything. Then the money is waste!",0
smooth and relaiable ride,0
smooth ride,0
smooth ride,0
So kind n humble,0
So... who the f care the driver is using Realme phone or not woh?,0
Some grab Driver in Malaysia are so rude!,0
sometimes it's quite sucks can't find a driver while lots of cars around. and while it's lower km distance that's hard to get Ride if get also the fare Will be high compared to long distance fare,0
"Sorry, I will throw away the grab application and will return to using the Gojek application because after calculating it, it turns out that grab is more expensive and it's very disappointing because often the promotions can't be used and a minimum order is also required to get free shipping but in reality you still have to pay shipping and it's free to subscribe to grab. unlimited",0
still not so cheap when it come to nearbyü•∫,0
"Stop forcing me to update ""to continue"". Let people update when its convenient, not when we are rushing",0
"Teribble service, 10x streaks location driver always too far from my location!!",0
"Terrible app...poor layout and cluttered design. Unable to amend payment. Was not clear that I had to pay in cash, could not pay with card after the trip, and took multiple tries with useless automated customer service to solve it myself direct with the lovely guy who drove me, no thanks to grab.",0
"Terrible service nowadays. Waiting for 40min to 1 hour, still not getting drivers",0
Thank you for sending Sy until you get home safely,0
Thank you sir rider for accommodating us.,0
thank you very convenient and feel safe‚ô•Ô∏è,0
The app does not automatically update the location of the app owner.,0
"The appearance is intended to be simple, but it actually makes users confused. Gojek's appearance is more user friendly. Even though sometimes Gojek is more expensive, Gojek is always the first one chosen hahaha",0
The car is available late. There is no other problem,0
the driver asks me to pay more than the original price?? from rm6 to rm8 my pick up point to the destination is not tht far why would the drive charge me more.,0
The driver has a good understanding of traffic laws,0
The driver is very helpful and accomodating,0
The driver is very polite.,0
The driver was excellent helped with my bags and the vehicle was Super Clean,0
"The driver was found quickly, not like an application that took a long time to find",0
The driver was very rude and cancelled the order for some reason also really hard to navigate where your location is,0
The fare gets more expensive when it's crowded.. It's noon,0
"The help center is not helpful. The driver also very problem and suddenly cancel my order when i am in rush for my personal matter üòÆ‚Äçüí®just because 4 person in 1 car include the driver . I don't understand, in 1 car should have 2 person include the driver??? I hope this things should not be happen again and please take action for this",0
"The service is fast, the demand for the price list just changed a little from what I expected. But the app navigates quickly",0
"The taxi getting slow at the moment, got cancelled a lot of times because the driver is too far away, pls fix the system",0
There are times when booking is hard. Fare is still high. Promos are always invalid or fully redeemed.,0
"There is a cancellation fee, but if the driver looks like a pig, there is no compensation",0
There Is not a single driver for 30 mins And the cost goes higher üëéüëéüëé,0
They are now matching further drivers to make you pay extra for 'premium' matching. My rides now match to drivers over 10 mins away under 'normal'. I accidentally clicked Premium and it matched under 30 sec to a driver 3 min away.,0
"They often change the price of a ride inside the app, which create a sudden outstanding payment. Such a bummer üëé",0
"This is an app that is very troublesome for irresponsible riders by canceling last minute, after 40 minutes waiting.Rm 5 voucher is very useless compared to not being able to go to class for school.Low rate is very suitable for this App.",0
"Tired of the driver. Type ""side application driver. Cust service üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª",0
"TOLL SCAM. Beware of grab car drivers illegally putting ""toll fee"" even if you paid it separately. These drivers put these fees illegally on top of your fare. Resolve this matter grab, your drivers should not have the power to authorize charges on our credit cards. I'll be reporting you to authorities.",0
"Too much expensive rates, for God sake 300% high fair, RM 22 I was using to return home from work now it's RM 45, come on, I think Malaysian government need to take a actions against this scam",0
Too pricy. It's RM 81 from Kepong to UNHCR Office at around 7:00 am in the morning on 08/03/2024. Imagine....! And the worst thing that has ever happened to me was that ur driver made me waited for 1 hour but never turned up. The incident happened on 28/02/2024. I wrote to the driver who accepted my booking enquiring about the reason for not turning up but the driver never responded back. I made calls too but the driver never bother to pick up. Such things are very unprofessional.,0
Traffic has improved around airport. Drivers are abundant and ready on call.,0
"Travel at night, avoid traffic nightmares...",0
Twas a great grab ride. driver was very professional and friendly.,0
unsatisfied with the service i get when it's urgent that i need to go somewhere. it must be intentional that i get drivers that accept and stay put for 20 minutes and not moving at all and the funny thing is it happens back to back. parang sinasadya nyo na mang-gago e pwede bang ayusin nyo,0
"Using all the cellphone promo icons, the driver's position is crazy... better function than fashion!!! Your UI/UIX designers suck!!",0
"very bad, it's already expensive even though it's close",0
Very comfortable and safe,0
Very efficiently,0
Very friendly driver,0
very good! helped me in Bali a lot!!,0
very helpful ‚ò∫Ô∏è,0
very nice communicate,0
"Very nice driver. Prompt,knowledgeable, and extremely friendly.",0
Very nice person great,0
very pleasant driver and clean car,0
Very pleasant driver!,0
very useful and easy to use in Bangkok and Vietnam,0
Waiting time for drivers was too long. The drivers picked up in wrong location but still said he arrived and only waited for me 5 minutes. I could not use that server but still had paid for that. Reported but no feedback,0
"Was a bit confused when taking a car for the first time, but overall easy to use app.",0
"What is this...i canceled two times because of the driver want to reach my place about 11 to 10 minutes so i try to book 3rd time and then the sistem show me, because of i cancel many times so i need to wait about 22 hours for the next grab booking, so mean for the whole day i canot use the grab right...what is this previously i can cancel and rebook again...grab why this happened is this your new guideline so its okay i will uninstall",0
What kind of app is this every time I want to order grab always busy driver..,0
"Where's the cheap grab car, wow, do you want to squeeze people's money, it's expensive, even 21 thousand",0
Why grab is not allowed for PAYMENT METHOD for FOOD and grab CAR????,0
Would be nice if had an option to pre-book,0
yes to jeepney phaseout,0
You are a good driver even if he passes,0
your driver told me to cancel the trip so he should be charged the penalty not me,0
Your service is poor. Drivers rejected my booking. From 5 stars now I rate 1 stars.,0
"Zero customer support. Drivers won't cancel on you, they just park their car and wait for you to cancel, then grab charges you. F grab. I'm addition basic app features are nonintuitive and don't work. F grab.",0
